Since 2001, I have specialized in designing, developing, upgrading, and maintaining MS Access databases, specializing in MS Access, SQL, Visual Basic, and a more limited experience with SQL Server. I also have limited experience with limited SQL Server. I have developed hundreds of different database applications, both for full-time employers and as a consultant with an international clientele. I have developed systems for companies such as Cigna, Citizens Bank, Department of Defense, E. & J. Gallo Winery, General Dynamics, Patheon, Pfizer, Raytheon, and Xerox. I have a Masters' degree from Rensselaer, in Management of Information Systems, and have a Microsoft Certification for Microsoft Access.

I review existing files and documents without cost or obligation, and then I typically provide either recommendations or a mock-up for review within 24 hours.
